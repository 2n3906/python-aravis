Pythonic interface to the auo-generated aravis bindings.

Minimal example code:

import aravis
ids = aravis.get_camera_ids() #List visible cameras
cam = Camera(ids[0]) #get the first camera
try:
    cam.start_acquisition_continuous()
    frame = cam.get_frame(wait=True)# get next frame from camera
    print("Saving frame to ", "myframe.npy")
    np.save(path, frame)
    cam.stop_acquisition()
finally:
    cam.shutdown()

Next read the other examples and the code

Rmq: Aravis needs to be compiled with intropsection support.
It requires at least libgirepository1.0-dev and gobject-introspection packges on ubuntu
